# Smart Meal Selection with Secure Verification

## Objective:
This project is a Java-based console application that allows hostel students to securely book a special meal token for their mess. The system ensures:

- User authentication before booking a meal.
- Each student can book only one meal per day to prevent duplicate bookings.
- The meal cost (â‚¹80.0) is automatically added to the student's mess bill.

## Tech Stack Used:
- **Java** (for core application logic)
- **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity for database operations)
- **MySQL** (for storing student and meal booking details)

## Features and Workflow:
### Secure User Verification:
- The system prompts the user to enter their email and password.
- It checks the `students` table to validate the credentials.

### Meal Selection and Booking:
- After successful login, the system verifies if the student has already booked a meal for the day.
- If eligible, a new meal booking entry is created in the `tokens` table, storing:
  - The studentâ€™s ID (retrieved using their email)
  - The current date (to ensure a single booking per day)
  - The meal charge (â‚¹80.0) added to their bill

### Prevention of Duplicate Bookings:
- If a student has already booked a meal, the system restricts multiple bookings for the same day.

## Database Schema:
### 1. `students` Table:
Stores student details.

| Column Name  | Data Type      | Description            |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| id          | INT (Primary Key) | Unique Student ID    |
| name        | VARCHAR(100)  | Student's Name        |
| emailid     | VARCHAR(100)  | Student's Email (Unique) |
| password    | VARCHAR(100)  | Encrypted Password    |

### 2. `tokens` Table:
Stores meal booking records.

| Column Name | Data Type  | Description               |
|------------|----------|---------------------------|
| token_id   | INT (Primary Key) | Unique Token ID    |
| student_id | INT (Foreign Key) | Refers to `students.id` |
| date       | DATE     | Date of Booking          |
| amount     | FLOAT    | Amount Charged (â‚¹80.0)   |

## Main Functionalities in Code:
### `verifyUser(email, password)`
- Validates the entered email and password against records in the `students` table.

### `canBookToken(email)`
- Checks whether the student has already booked a meal for the current date.

### `addToken(email)`
- If eligible, inserts a new meal booking record into the `tokens` table and adds the charge to their bill.

## Potential Enhancements:
âœ… Implement a GUI-based interface using Swing or JavaFX.
âœ… Use password encryption for better security.
âœ… Provide custom meal options instead of a fixed meal price.
âœ… Send email/SMS confirmations upon successful booking.
âœ… Generate monthly meal usage reports for students.

This project enhances hostel mess management by ensuring secure verification and smart meal booking, making the process efficient and user-friendly. ðŸš€
